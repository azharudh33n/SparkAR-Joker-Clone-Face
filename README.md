# Joker Clone Face Using Facebook Spark AR Studio

<b> Brief </b> <br>
Use the patch editor to create an interactive clown mask effect that is affected by the user's mouth interactions.

<b> Rubric </b> <br>
Use the Face Target to place a red ball on top of your nose
Use any Face Interaction or Face Landmark patch on the patch editor to detect a change in the user's mouth.
This interaction should animate the scale of the red ball to grow bigger by using patches.
When the user brings their face back to normal, the red ball should return to normal size.
Use an interaction patch to detect a tap on the screen and on doing so make the ball disappear.
Make the ball reappear on tapping the screen again.
You can add in your own textures to the face mesh to create a unique clown mask and be creative.
Test your effect out on the Spark AR Player app and send in a recording of you using the effect.
